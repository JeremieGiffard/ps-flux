#React app with flux

This is a code-along project, based on `Cory House's` "Building Application with React and Flux" from pluralsight .

I made the SelectInput.js component and the deleted toast event.
I also connected the mock api authorApi.js to the app to get the authors list from the json.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` ### `npm test` ### `npm run build`
